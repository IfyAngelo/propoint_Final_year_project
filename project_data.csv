 It's so bad that you leave a chair in the sitting room  for another chair in that same sitting room, or you place your phone on your head to tap network..lol

It's a fact also that one network is better in a particular geographical location than the other. Take for instance, I'd prefer to use Glo in Ife and MTN in Ibadan because of where I stay in both places.

In all, the quality of service is frustrating, and the usage is expensive because it's data consuming "
